instance.packages
=========

This role installs apt, pip, and npm packages.

Future improvements include adding list variables for `_all`, `_group`, and `_host`, so that we can have flattened lists. (Example: some packages might get installed on just a single host, but include both group packages and ALL packages).

- Python and python-pip, if pip packages are to be installed.
